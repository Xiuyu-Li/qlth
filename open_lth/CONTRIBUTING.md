We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as
possible.

## Pull Requests
We actively welcome your pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code, please also add unit tests using the Python `unittest` framework and libraries available in the `testing` directory.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation and tutorials. Ensure that all changes are backwards compatible and will not change the behavior or storage location of existing models.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints using [pylint](https://www.pylint.org/) and [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/).
6. If you haven't already, complete the Contributor License Agreement ("CLA").
7. Make a pull request for the fork.

## Issues
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Please ensure your description is
clear and has sufficient instructions to be able to reproduce the issue.

Facebook has a [bounty program](https://www.facebook.com/whitehat/) for the safe
disclosure of security bugs. In those cases, please go through the process
outlined on that page and do not file a public issue.

## Coding Style  
* 4 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
* 120 character line limit
* Please follow the style in the existing codebase

## Caveats

Our goal is to keep this codebase concise, simple, and easy to extend.
We are trying to avoid adding code for specialized purposes that are not generally applicable to future users of this codebase under the goals laid out in the readme.
We ask that you propose changes with the spirit of this purpose in mind, and we may request modification or reject changes if we think they will add too much clutter.

This codebase will largely be maintained by Jonathan Frankle. He's a busy PhD student, and he apologizes in advance that his response time will be slow.
Please follow the processes outlined in this document for making contributions and noting issues rather than contacting him directly, and please be patient and understanding with him.
